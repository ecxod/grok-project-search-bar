# Grok Project Search Bar
Grok.com Projects – Instant Live Search (v1 – Title-only)

This tiny userscript instantly adds a beautiful, native-looking search bar at the top of https://grok.com/project that filters your projects **live as you type** – no Enter key needed.

What it does:
- Adds a sleek search field right under the tabs (“Meine Projekte”, “Mit mir geteilt”, “Beispiele”)
- Filters projects in real time based on the project title
- Works instantly on every keystroke (including Backspace)
- Press Escape to clear the search
- Shows a small counter (“12 of 87 found”)
- Looks and feels exactly like a built-in Grok feature

Perfect if you have dozens or hundreds of projects and hate scrolling.

How to install (30 seconds):

1. Install the free browser extension **Code Injector** by Lor-Saba  
   → https://github.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector
2. Click the Code Injector icon → “+ New Script”
3. Give it a name, e.g. “Grok Projects Search”
4. Paste the entire script (the one starting with `// ==UserScript==`)
5. Set the URL pattern to: `https://grok.com/project*`
6. Save and reload https://grok.com/project

Done! You now have the fastest project search on Grok.com – faster and prettier than the official page.

Enjoy.
